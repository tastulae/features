Feature: As a participant
  In order to control my visibility / location disclosure to others
  I use the buttons on my chip

  # Scenario: I do not want anyone to know where I am
  # Scenario: I want people to know they saw me today on their [morning|evening] commute
  # Scenario: I want people to know they [live|work] near me
  # Scenario: I want [certain verified nice|etc] people to know I am there when they are within X feet of me
  # Scenario: I'm shopping and I might want to be subtle and blend in (look like any other customer transacting) (is there a mode for this?)
  # Scenario: [many other scenarios]
